## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! 👋 I'm a passionate and detail-oriented person with a recent graduation from QA Engineer course.

As an IT professional, but also with a financial background, my interest is mainly focused on the new technologies area, modern applications, and tools, that could be used daily, at work or home.

The integration between software and hardware, software and other tools to improve the speed or minimize the bugs are areas, where I have a professional curiosity.
Cloud computing is another topic, that brings my attention, to be up to date with the new way of usage and delivery of a product.
Based on experience, Quality Assurance is a critical area that could define if a product would be successful or not.

I have gained valuable experience by working on a variety of projects and utilizing different tools, all of which I've diligently practiced and refined. You can explore some of my work across six repositories, which demonstrate my dedication and proficiency.
